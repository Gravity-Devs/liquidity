# Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone. The `develop` contains the development version. You can branch of from `develop` and create a pull request, or maintain your own fork and submit a cross-repository pull request. Thank you to all those who have contributed to the liquidity module!

Please follow standard github best practices: 

- fork the repo
- branch from the tip of develop
- make some commits
- submit a pull request to develop 

See the open issues for things we need help with!

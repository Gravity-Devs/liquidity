# Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone. The `develop` contains the development version. You can branch of from `develop` and create a pull request, or maintain your own fork and submit a cross-repository pull request. Thank you to all those who have contributed to the liquidity module!

Please follow standard github best practices: 

- Fork the repository
- Make sure your `branch` is from the tip of `develop`
- Make some commits
- Submit a pull request to `develop`

Rule of thumb:

- Run tests and make sure there is no issue
- Review code coverage report
- Review if there is any linting issue
